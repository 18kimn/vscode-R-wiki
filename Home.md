vscode-R is the R Extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The extension is mainly focused on providing user interactivity between VSCode and R sessions. To make VSCode more powerful in R scripting, it is highly recommended to also install the R language server ([languageserver](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver) and [vscode-r-lsp](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r-lsp)).
