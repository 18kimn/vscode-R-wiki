For many R users, [RStudio](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio) has long been a great integrated development environment for data analysis and visualization. It provides a rich set of features that make it unprecedentedly easy to perform a wide range of tasks interactively.

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), in contrast, is not specifically designed for a certain programming language. It is highly customizable through [settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings), and highly extensive through [extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/). It supports many programming languages at different levels through language extensions that implement some common protocols such as the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) to enable language features based on code analysis such as *Go To Definition* and *Rename symbol*, and the [Debug Adapter Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol/) to enable interactive debugging of any target.
