## Create R terminal

In VS Code window, press <kbd>F1</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd>) and choose "R: Create R terminal" command, then the VS Code terminal will be revealed and an R terminal will be launched.

By default, the official `R` terminal is launched.

## Sending code to R terminals

* If a range of code is selected, then the selected code will be sent to the terminal.
* If no code is selected, then an executable range of code will be sent to the terminal and the cursor will move to the next line.

## Using multiple R terminals

Each time "R: Create R terminal" is executed, a new R terminal is created. The user could switch between these R terminals, and customize the icon color and the label of each terminal.
